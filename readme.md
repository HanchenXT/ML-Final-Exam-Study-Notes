###Unsupervised Learning
UL consists of algorithms that are meant to "explore" on their own and provide  
the user with valuable information concerning their dataset/problem  

* Clustering
  * K Means
  * Expectation Maximization

* Feature Selection
  * Filtering
  * Wrapping
  * Relevance

* Feature Transformation
  * PCA
  * ICA
  * LDA
  * More?

* Information Theory
  * ...

###Reinforcement Learning
Put an agent into a world (make sure you can describe it with an MDP!), give him
some rewards and penalties and hopefully he will learn.

* Markov Decision Processes
  * States, Transitions, Rewards
  * Policy Iteration
  * Value Iteration

* Q Learning
  * Learning Rate
  * Exploration vs Exploitation

* Game Theory
